"Tethyrd"
What Would Molydeux? SF 2012


Idea:
What if you lived in a world where all guns are required to be plugged into wall
sockets? Now THAT would be a tactical shooter wouldn't it?

What if the more XP you gained, the longer your gun extension cable grows? What
if you had scissors to cut enemies' cables? True potential.
